# prefix-suffix-search
A data-structures–based implementation of Prefix Trees (Tries) and Suffix Trees for fast pattern matching in long biological sequences. This project demonstrates how tree-based indexing can efficiently search for short sequences—such as genes, motifs, or regulatory elements—within large genomes.
